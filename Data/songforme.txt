Hello Mukund Shukla, it's nice to meet you! I'd be happy to write a song for you. Here's a short and simple song that I came up with:

(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the night, I sit and think of you
Your smile, your laugh, the things you do
The way you light up a room, the way you make me feel
The memories we've made, both big and small, are so real

(Chorus)
Mukund, my friend, you mean the world to me
Together we'll face whatever comes our way
With laughter, love, and memories
We'll chase our dreams and make our own way

(Verse 2)
Through the highs and the lows, the twists and the turns
We'll stick together, our bond will never burn
With every step we take, we'll grow and learn
Together we'll shine, our love will always burn

(Chorus)
Mukund, my friend, you mean the world to me
Together we'll face whatever comes our way
With laughter, love, and memories
We'll chase our dreams and make our own way

(Bridge)
The world may change, but one thing's for sure
Our friendship will last, forever pure
Through the good and the bad, the thick and the thin
We'll stand together, our bond will never end

(Chorus)
Mukund, my friend, you mean the world to me
Together we'll face whatever comes our way
With laughter, love, and memories
We'll chase our dreams and make our own way

I hope you like the song, Mukund! Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
