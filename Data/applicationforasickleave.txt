Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, with symptoms including a high fever, body aches, and severe fatigue. I have consulted with my doctor, who has advised me to take a few days off to rest and recover.

I regret any inconvenience this may cause to the team, and I will do my best to ensure that my work is up to date before I leave. I will also be checking my email periodically during my absence and will respond to any urgent messages as soon as I am able.

I am planning to return to work on [date], but I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know if my return date changes. In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything I can do to help with the workload or if there is any additional information you need from me.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

Mukund Shukla
