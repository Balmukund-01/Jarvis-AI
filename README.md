# Jarvis AI - Personal Assistant

### **Description**
🚀 Welcome to **Jarvis AI** – a beginner-friendly personal assistant project inspired by Marvel's iconic "Jarvis." This AI combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, object detection, and system automation for an interactive experience. Perfect for developers starting their journey in AI and automation! 

---

### **Features**
✨ **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text with ease.
🎙️ **Text-to-Speech**: Responds with natural-sounding voice feedback.
🖼️ **Object Detection**: Identifies objects in real-time using the system camera.
🛠️ **System Automation**: Handles tasks like opening apps, adjusting volume, and more.
📂 **Modular Design**: Well-organized Backend and Frontend modules for scalability.

---

### **Technologies Used**
🔧 **Python Libraries**:
- `OpenCV` - Enables object detection with YOLO.
- `PyGame` - Powers text-to-speech playback.
- `Selenium` - Implements speech-to-text functionality.
- `dotenv` - Manages environment variables.

🤖 **AI Models**:
- Pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection.

🛠️ **Tools**:
- `VS Code` - Development environment.
- `GitHub` - For version control and hosting.

### **Setup and Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis-ai.git
   cd jarvis-ai
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add a `.env` file to the project root with the following:
   ```env
   InputLanguage=en-US
   AssistantVoice=Jenny
   Username=YourName
   Assistantname=Jarvis
   GroqAPIKey=your-api-key
   ```

4. Run the assistant:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Speech Recognition**: Jarvis listens to your voice commands and converts them into text.
2. **Text-to-Speech**: Jarvis responds with a natural voice generated using edge TTS.
3. **Object Detection**: Open the "Eye" feature, and Jarvis uses the camera to detect and identify objects.
4. **System Automation**: Perform tasks like opening apps, muting/unmuting the system, and much more.

### **Planned Enhancements**
🧠 **Advanced AI Integration**: Add GPT-based conversational AI for enhanced user interactions.
🔍 **Improved Object Detection**: Integrate custom-trained models for more accurate object recognition.
📅 **Task Scheduling**: Add reminder and calendar integrations.
